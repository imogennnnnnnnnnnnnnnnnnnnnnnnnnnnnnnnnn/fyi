Fresco is a video sharing platform that allows citizen journalists to respond to assignments and sell their content to news outlets.

As Chief Design Officer, I led product ideation and strategy and was the sole product designer for all platforms. The company built its business model around my work, and has received over $6 million in funding as of my departure in early 2017.

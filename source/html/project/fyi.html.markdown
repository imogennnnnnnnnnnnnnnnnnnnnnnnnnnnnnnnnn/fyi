***FYI*** is my personal branding project, for which I have the narrow goal of keeping my visual presentation consistent across all contexts and media. It's not that serious, but it's nice to have.

Design and music each have their own rules and elements to serve different audiences, but both pull from a shared set of guidelines for typography and layout. 

This is **version 3**. Here's what's new:
- The main color palette has been condensed from red, orange, yellow, & blue to a bright RGB set.
- A second font, [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla), has been added. [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono) is cool, but it got pretty hard to read in paragraphs.
- This whole website was rewritten from scratch! My old build tool broke in an update, so rather than revert I started fresh with [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) and made some improvements, like:
  - I can write projects up in Markdown, with all of the HTML for the pages in one layout file
  - On phones, you can smoothly drag cards left and right.
  - We're hosted on [Surge Plus](https://surge.sh) now, with forced HTTPS
